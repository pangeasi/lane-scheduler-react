# Lane Scheduler React

A flexible, drag-and-drop scheduler component library for React with full TypeScript support.

## Overview

Lane Scheduler React provides a powerful and flexible scheduling interface that allows users to:

- **Drag & Drop** appointments within and between lanes
- **Resize** appointments by dragging their edges
- **Block** specific time slots
- **Lock** appointments to prevent modification
- **Customize** rendering with render props
- **Handle** touch events for mobile support

## Core Concepts

### Scheduler

The `Scheduler` component provides the context for drag & drop operations. It coordinates state between multiple lanes and handles cross-lane appointment movements.

### Lane

The `Lane` component represents a single scheduling timeline. Each lane can contain multiple appointments and has its own blocked slots and configuration.

### Appointments

Appointments are the schedulable items that can be moved and resized. They have properties like:

- `startSlot` - The starting time slot
- `duration` - How many slots the appointment spans
- `title` - Display text
- `locked` - Whether the appointment can be modified
- `allowOverlap` - Whether appointments can overlap
- `onBlockedSlot` - Custom logic for blocked slot handling

## Key Features

### 🎯 Drag & Drop

- Move appointments within lanes or between different lanes
- Visual feedback during dragging
- Snap to slot boundaries
- Invalid position indicators

### 📏 Resizable Appointments

- Resize from start or end edges
- Minimum duration constraints
- Overlap detection and prevention
- Visual resize handles

### 🔒 Blocked Slots

- Define unavailable time periods
- Custom logic with `onBlockedSlot` callback
- Visual indicators for blocked times
- VIP appointments can override blocks

### 🎨 Customizable Rendering

- `renderSlot` - Custom slot appearance and content
- `renderAppointmentContent` - Custom appointment display
- Flexible styling with CSS classes
- Responsive design support

### 📱 Mobile Support

- Touch event handling
- Responsive layouts
- Mobile-optimized interactions
- Viewport-aware controls

## TypeScript Support

The library is built with TypeScript and provides comprehensive type definitions for:

- All component props and configurations
- Appointment and lane data structures
- Event handler signatures
- Custom render function types

## Architecture

The library uses React Context to coordinate drag & drop state between components:

```
<Scheduler> (provides drag context)
  └── <Lane> (individual timeline)
      ├── Appointments (draggable/resizable)
      └── Time Slots (clickable/droppable)
```

This architecture allows for:

- Clean separation of concerns
- Efficient state management
- Easy composition of multiple lanes
- Extensible functionality

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES2018+ support
- Touch devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- React 18+ required

## Performance

The library is optimized for performance with:

- Efficient re-rendering using React hooks
- Minimal DOM updates during drag operations
- Debounced event handlers
- Lazy calculation of overlap detection
